        This was a amazing bootcamp taken up by Sir Shaurya Sinha. I got to
        learn a lot during these seven days and it was an amazing experince
        learning with ShapeAI. All the topics of JavaScript and React.js was
        covered from the very basics. I learnt a lot during this session,
        which was a great experience. I am eagerly waiting for the upcoming
        bootcamps to learn new things.
